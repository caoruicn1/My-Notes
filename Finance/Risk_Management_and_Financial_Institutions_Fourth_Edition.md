## CHAPTER 4 Mutual Funds and Hedge Funds

- **Mutual Funds vs. Hedge Funds**
	- **Mutual funds/unit trusts**		- Serve a large number of small investors		- More regulation in terms of investment strategies		- Public investment strategies
		- One of the attractions of mutual funds for the small investor is the *diversification opportunities* they offer
		- Money market mutual funds *invest in* interest-bearing instruments, such as Trea- sury bills, commercial paper, and bankers’ acceptances, with a life of less than one year.	- **Hedge funds**		- Serve a small number of wealthy individuals and large investors such as pension funds		- Less regulated		- Less disclosure- **Type of Assets Invested by Mutual Funds**
	- **Money market mutual funds**		- invest in interest-bearing instruments, such as 

		1. Treasury bills
		2. commercial paper 
		3. bankers’ acceptances, with a life of less than one year.	- **Long term funds**		1. Bond funds that invest in  xed income securities with a life of more than one year.		2. Equity funds that invest in common and preferred stock.		3. Hybrid funds that invest in stocks, bonds, and other securities.

- **Open-End Fund**
	- The most common type of mutual fund is an open-end fund	- The number of shares in the fund goes up (issue) as investors buy more shares and down (redeem) as they redeem shares	- Net asset value (NAV) of fund is the value of its investments  divided by number of shares	- All purchases and sales of shares are at the 4pm NAV regardless of the market value of a fund when you buy/sell the fund- **Index Funds**
	- Designed to track a particular index (e.g. S&P500, Dow Jones)	- Passive funds (buy and hold)	- Tracking Methods		1. Buy all the shares in the index in amount that reflect their weight		2. A small portfolio of representative shares which track the index closely		3. Index futures	- Tracking error and expense ratio
		- The tracking error of a fund can be de ned as either the root mean square error of the difference between the fund’s return per year and the index return per year or as the standard deviation of this difference
		- The expense ratio is the fee charged per year, as a percentage of assets, for administering the fund.- **Costs**
	- Annual fee	- Front-end load		- A fee charged when an investor first buys shares in a mutual fund		- Not all funds charge the fee	- Back-end load		- A fee charged when an investor sells shares.		- Decline with the length of holding period	- Total expense ratio = annual fee per share / share value	- We can measure $$Total\ cost\ per\ year = Total\ expense\ ratio + \frac{Front\ end\ load}{5} + \frac{Back\ end\ load}{5}$$		- Relatively low in US		- Relatively high in other countries- **Closed-End Fund**
	- Open-end funds are the most common type of funds. The number of shares outstanding varies from day to day (flexible supply of shares)	- A closed-end fund consists of a fixed number of shares that can be traded at any time during market opening hours (fixed supply of shares)	- Two NAVs		1. Price at which the shares of the fund are trading		2. Market value of the fund’s portfolio divided by the number of shares outstanding (fair market value of a fund)They may not be the same- **Exchange-Traded Funds(ETFs)**
	- Mix the advantages of both open- and close-end funds		- Flexible supply of shares		- Can be traded at any time during market opening hours	- Most of them are passive funds (buy and hold)		- In 2008, actively managed ETFs are authorized 	- Often designed to track an index (index funds)	- Started by an institutional investor that deposits a block of securities and obtains shares in the fund 	- Shares are traded on an exchange
	- Large institutional investors can exchange large blocks of shares in the ETF for the underlying assets, and vice versa		- This keeps the share price close to the NAV of the fund’s investments		- If the spread in price is large, institutional investors arbitrage 

- **Advantages of ETFs over Open- and Closed-End Mutual Funds**
	1. Lower expense	2. Trading ETFs is very similar to trading stocks. They can be bought or sold (or even shorted) at any time during market opening hours	3. Holdings are disclosed on daily basis	4. Investments do not have to be sold to cover redemptions	5. Share price close to NAV of underlying investments
