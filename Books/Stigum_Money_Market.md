# CHAPTER 1 Introduction

The money market is a wholesale market for low-risk, highly liquid, short-term
IOUs.

# CHAPTER 2 Funds Flows, Banks, and Money Creation

*   **Three major parts**
    *   the stock market
    *   the bond market
    *   the money market

## FUNDS FLOWS IN THE U.S. CAPITAL MARKET

*   The surplus that nonfinancial businesses rang up in 2005 is highly unusual
    from a historical perspective, as the business sector tends to have a
    chronic funds deficit. The deficit is commonly known as the corporate
    financing gap

*   Corporate financing gap (corporate profits minus capital spending, in
    billions of dollars)

*   **Sector of U.S. capital market**
    *   Households, Nonfinancial Business, State and Local Government, U.S
        Governments, Financial Business, Rest of the World
    *   Households are, after all, the major income recipients, and business
        firms are the major investors
    *   Every funds deficit has to be covered by the receipt of debt or equity
        capital from outside sources, and every funds surplus must be absorbed
        by supplying such capital

## FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES

*   **Direct finance**

    *   borrows directly from ultimate funds-surplus units or sells equity
        claims against itself directly to such spending units

*   **Indirect finance**

    *   the funds flow from the surplus to the deficit unit via a financial
        intermediary. Banks, savings and loan associations, life insurance
        companies, pension funds, and mutual funds are all examples of financial
        intermediaries

*   **Indirect securities**

    *   demand deposits, time deposits, money market and other mutual fund
        shares, and the cash value of life insurance policies

*   **Primary securities**

    *   invest in stocks, bonds, and other securities issued by ultimate
        funds-deficit units

*   **The Reasons for Intermediation**

    *   The main reason for all the intermediation that occurs in our economy is
        that the mix of primary securities offered by funds-deficit units is
        unattractive to many funds-surplus units

*   **BANKS, A SPECIAL INTERMEDIARY**
    *   First, they are by far the largest intermediary; they receive huge
        quantities of demand deposits (i.e., checking account money) and time
        deposits
    *   Second, in the course of their lending activity, banks create money
        *   As the T-accounts show, the immediate effect of the loan is to
            increase total demand deposits, but no offsetting decrease has
            occurred in the amount of currency in circulation

## THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S ROLE

*   First, the Fed was charged with treating an elastic supply of currency
*   The Fed was to solve this problem by standing ready during panics to extend
    to the banks at the discount window loans whose proceeds could be paid out
    in Federal Reserve notes
*   **countercyclical monetary policy**
    *   promote full employment and price stability by limiting the growth of
        bank intermediation when the economy expands too vigorously and by
        encouraging it when the economy slips into recession
*   **Phillips curve**

    *   a stable predictive relationship between inflation and economic growth

*   **Federal Reserve notes**

    *   a non-interest- bearing indirect security issued by the Fed

*   **Controlling the Level of Bank Intermediation**

    *   **Open market operations**(main tool)
        *   purchases and sales by the Fed of government securities
        *   banks may choose not to fully utilize the reserves available to them
    *   **Reserve requirements**(rarely used)
        *   each district Federal Reserve Bank acts in effect as a banker to
            commercial banks in its district, holding what amounts to checking
            accounts for them
    *   Fed must still constantly increase the amount of currency in circulation
        because, as the economy expands, more currency is needed by the public
        for ordinary transactions

    *   **Discount Window**(key tool)
        *   over time the Fed switched from controlling bank reserves through
            discounting to controlling them through open market operations. This
            **switch** makes sense for several reasons
        *   First, it puts the Fed in the position of being able to take the
            initiative
        *   Second, the size and liquidity of the market for government
            securities are such that the Fed can make substantial purchases and
            sales there without disrupting the market or causing more than
            negligible price changes
        *   Today, borrowing at the discount window represents a small element
            in the total reserves available to member banks

## MONEY SUPPLY AND FED CONTROL OVER IT

*   any easing or tightening by the Fed necessarily alters not only money supply
    growth, but interest rates as well

*   **Fed funds rate**

    *   banks borrow and lend excess reserves to one another in the federal
        funds market
    *   fed funds rate **UP**
        *   drives **up** other short-term interest rates
        *   viewed money as **tight**
        *   high and rising interest rates would **discourage** spending and the
            expansion of economic activity
    *   fed funds rate **DOWN**

        *   drives **down** other short-term interest rates
        *   viewed money as **easy**
        *   low interest rates would **encourage** spending and the expansion of
            economic activity

    *   Fed should seek to peg not the Fed rate but the rate of growth of money

# CHAPTER 3 The Instruments in Brief

## DEALERS AND BROKERS

*   **Dealers**
    *   Dealers make markets in money market instruments by quoting—to each
        other, to issuers, and to investors—bid and asked prices at which they
        are prepared to buy and sell
    *   Dealers also act as agent in the issuance of commercial paper and
        medium-term notes (MTNs), including bank deposit notes
*   **Brokers**
    *   Brokers bring buyers and sellers together for a commission

## U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES

*   **Treasury bills(T-bills)**
    *   T-bills bear no interest.
    *   An investor in bills earns a return because bills are issued at a
        discount from face value and redeemed by the Treasury at maturity for
        face value
    *   a maturity at issue of a year or less
    *   T-bills are currently issued in 4-week, 3-month, and 6-month matu-
        rities
    *   sold at yield auctions, price determined by the market.
*   **interest-bearing notes**

    *   Notes have an original maturity (maturity at issue) of 2 to 10 years
    *   Currently, the Treasury issues 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year notes on a
        regular cycle
    *   Interest on Treasury notes is paid **semiannually**
    *   sold at yield auctions, price determined by the market.

*   **interest-bearing negotiable bonds**

    *   a maturity at issue of 30 years
    *   sold at yield auctions, price determined by the market.

*   **Investors**

    *   Banks, other financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds,
        and corporations
    *   foreign central banks and foreign institutions
    *   Individual investors

*   **Several advantages**

    *   First, highly liquid
    *   Second, free from credit risk
    *   Third, interest income on governments is exempt from state taxation
    *   Fourth, because the U.S. dollar remains the reserve currency in the
        global financial system, the Treasury market is truly a global market

*   bills and governments having a short current maturity normally trade at
    yields below those of other money market instruments.
*   Generally, yields on governments are higher the longer their current
    maturity, because the longer the current maturity of a debt security, the
    more its price will fluctuate.

    *   **yield curve inverts**
        1.  preceded economic recessions
        2.  borrowers choose to borrow short term while investors seek out
            long-term securities

*   **Zero-coupon securities**（zeros）

    *   Each such piece was a non-interest-bearing security with a fixed
        maturity and a fixed value at maturity
    *   **STRIPS**
        *   Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities

*   **International**
    *   Foreigners, and most importantly Asian investors, have become big buyers
        of Treasury securities

## FEDERAL AGENCY SECURITIES

*   **Two types of federal agency securities**

    1.  government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
        *   the two largest GSEs: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
    2.  federally related institutions

*   **Issued**

    *   Most agency securities are issued by GSEs
    *   federally related institutions only rarely issue debt on their own but
        instead obtain funding from the Federal Financing Bank

*   **Federally related institutions**

    1.  the Federal Home Loan Bank System
        *   lends to the nation’s savings and loan associations as well as
            regulates them
    2.  the Government National Mortgage Association
        *   funnels money into the mortgage market
    3.  Banks for Cooperatives
        *   make seasonal and term loans to farm cooperatives
    4.  Federal Land Banks
        *   give mortgages on farm properties
    5.  Federal Intermediate Credit Banks
        *   provide short-term financing for producers of crops and livestock
    6.  a host of other agencies such as the Maritime Administration, the
        Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Export-Import Bank of the United
        States

*   **Reason why agencies yield slightly more than Treasury securities of the
    same maturity**
    *   First, the agency issue market is smaller than Treasury issues and
        therefore less liquid
    *   Second, only the federally related institutions backed by the full faith
        and credit of the U.S. government.
    *   Third, subject to state taxation.

## FEDERAL FUNDS

*   **Reserves requirement**

    *   All banks and other depository institutions are required to keep
        reserves on deposit at their District Federal Reserve Bank
    *   required by law to maintain some minimum average balance in its reserve
        account over a two-week period
    *   begins on Thursday and ends two weeks later on Wednesday, known as
        settlement Wednesday

*   **Federal funds market**

    *   Borrowing between banks is done in the federal funds market
    *   it is natural for large banks to borrow the excess funds held by smaller
        banks
    *   the lending of fed funds is referred to as a **sale** and the borrowing
        of fed funds as a **purchase**
    *   Fed funds traded for periods other than overnight are referred to as
        **term fed funds**

*   **Fed funds rate**
    *   The rate of interest paid on overnight loans of federal funds
    *   putting downward pressure on the federal funds rate by increases the
        availability of bank reserves and the money supply by **open market
        operation**
    *   interest rates on **long-term securities** are closely linked to
        expectations of the funds rate

## REPOS AND REVERSES

*   **Repurchase agreements**(RP agreements or repos)

    *   repo: selling collateral
    *   lending: buying collateral

*   **Types**

    1.  Most repo financing done by dealers is on an overnight basis
    2.  **term repos**: one week to as much as six months

*   **Why attractive**

    *   First, keep surplus funds invested without losing liquidity or incurring
        a price risk.
    *   Second, little or no credit risk.

*   **Why repo rate lower than the fed funds rate**

    *   repo: lower risk
    *   The spread widens if the fed funds rate is increasing rapidly and
        narrows when the fed funds rate is stable or declining

*   **Term repose**:

    *   higher interest-rate risk and credit risk
    *   lose some liquidity

*   **Reverse repo**

    *   From the point of view of a lender
    *   Used to cover a short position
    *   Typically, to a dealer hunting money, it’s a repo; to a dealer hunting
        securities, it’s a reverse

*   **GCF (general collateral finance) repo**

    *   reversed every morning and renewed every day, allowing the borrower use
        of collateral securities during the trading day

*   **System repos**
    *   The Fed’s purchase of collateral in its repo transactions with the
        Street are called **system repos**
    *   The Fed’s sales of securities in its reverse repo transactions are
        called **matched sales**

## EURODOLLARS

*   a Eurodollar deposit is simply a deposit denominated in dollars in a bank or
    bank branch outside the United States
*   the rate on overnight Eurodollars tends to closely track the fed funds rate

## FRAS

*   **Forward rate agreement (FRA)**
    *   A forward rate agreement is the over-the-counter(OTC) equivalent of a
        Eurodollar futures contract.
    *   two parties agree to trade a specific interest rate on a Eurodollar
        deposit of a specified currency, maturity, and amount, begin- ning on a
        specified date in the future, usually between **three and six months**
    *   What distinguishes a FRA from a forward trade is that, when the future
        date specified in the FRA agreement arrives, no Eurodeposit changes
        hands, just pay the buyer the difference.

## COMMERCIAL PAPER

*   Commercial paper is an unsecured promissory note issued for a specific
    amount and maturing on a specific day
*   **Maturity**

    *   Maximum maturity: 270 days
    *   Most: 90 days and under
    *   average: 45 days

*   Used to finance “current transactions, therefore tracking commercial paper
    issuance is a good way to track developments in the economy.

*   For the most part, only companies with extremely high credit ratings issue
    commercial paper because investors demand a very low default risk

*   commercial paper are slightly higher than those on **Treasury** obligations
    of similar maturity

## INTEREST-RATE SWAPS

*   **Coupon swap**

    *   actually it is Liability swap.
    *   fixed- or floating-rate money
    *   natural variation: cross-currency swap

*   **Cocktail swap**

    *   When an entity borrows X and then does several swaps to get to Y, which
        is what he wants, he is said to cocktail swaps

*   **The standardization of swap**

    *   LIBOR: the London Interbank Offered Rate for Eurodollar deposits
    *   with a spread risk: the spread of the LIBOR to the commercial paper rate

*   **Asset swaps**

## OPTIONS

*   Options, like futures, are actively traded by portfolio man- agers, hedgers,
    speculators, and arbitrageurs

*   **Two types**

    1.  **Exchange-traded** options are options on **futures contracts**
    2.  **Over-the-counter** options traded on **cash governments**

*   **Caps**

    *   the cap gives the borrower the right to pay either the cap rate or the
        formula loan-agreement rate, whichever is lower
    *   combination of call option

*   **Floors**
    *   A floor in contrast is a series of options that promises a receiver of a
        variable rate the right to receive either the floor rate or the formula
        variable rate, whichever is higher
    *   combination of put option

-   **Collars**
    *   A collar is a cap cum floor that holds a rate within a given range
-   **Options pricing**

    *   Black-Scholes model

-   Users of options often engage in cross-hedging, which is a hedge in which
    the security to be hedged is different from that of the vehicle used for the
    hedge

-   A popular option product is the swaption, which is an option on an
    interest-rate swap.

## CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND DEPOSIT NOTES

*   **Certificates of deposit(CDs)**
    *   A certificate of deposit (CD) is a certificate which indicates that a
        specified sum of money has been deposited in the issuing depository
        institution
    *   The certificate states _the amount of the deposit_, _maturity date of
        the deposit_, _the interest rate_, and _the method_ by which the
        interest is calculated
    *   Nonnegotiable CDs **must be held** by the depositor until the maturity
        date
    *   Negotiable CDs **allow the owner to sell** the CDs on the open market
        prior to the maturity date.
    *   The interest rate and term on CDs can vary.
*   **Four types of CDs**

    1.  Domestic CDs are issued by domestic banks
    2.  Eurodollar CDs (Euro CDs) are issued outside the United States but are
        denominated in dollars
        *   the liability of either the foreign branch of a U.S. bank or of some
            other foreign bank
        *   Rate: Most Eurodollar CDs are fixed rate
        *   Maturity: from three to six months
        *   Average maturity: less than six months
        *   Advantages: offer a higher return than do domestic CDs, free of
            Federal Reserve statutory requirements
        *   Diadvantages: less liquid
    3.  Yankee CDs are denominated in dollars and are issued by a foreign bank’s
        branch within the United States
    4.  Thrift CDs are issued by savings and loan associ- ations and savings
        banks

*   **Deposit note**

    *   Deposit notes are generally sold to institutional investors in
        denominations of \$1 million, but federal deposit insurance covers only
        \$100,000 of the deposit
    *   Original maturities on deposit notes range from 18 months to 5 years
    *   Usually do an interest-rate swap, fixed for floating
    *   Variant: Bank notes

*   Bank paper always trades at a spread above Treasuries of the same maturity
    because of some credit risk and less liquid than Treasuries.

## BANKERS' ACCEPTANCES

*   **Definition**

    *   **Draft**: A draft is a promise to pay
    *   **Time draft**: A draft that the date of the payment is in the future
    *   **Acceptance**: A time draft, payment of which has been guaranteed
        (accepted) by a financial institution
    *   **Bankers' acceptance(BA)**: The financial institution of an acceptance
        is a bank

*   **Ussage**

    *   BAs are typically used in the trade of goods, often in importing and
        exporting with firms from foreign countries
    *   the manufacturer typically presents the BA for payment prior to the
        maturity date and receives a discounted amount, less than the face value
    *   bank is still responsible for making payment
    *   BAs are highly liquid
    *   Only large banks with well-staffed foreign departments act as accepting
        banks
    *   BAs compete with commercial papers and bank loans, but only on a small
        scale, but not well suited to modern finance

*   **Bear**
    *   BAs bear the guarantee (acceptance) of a bank rather than a corporation
    *   usually issued in denominations **over \$100,000**, and their maturities
        generally range from **30 to 180 days**

## LOAN PARTICIPATIONS

*   **Definition**
    *   Loan participations are loans shared by a group of banks - when the loan
        might be too large for any one of the banks to make on its own
        *   bank wants to allocate its capital

## MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

*   **Definition**

    *   MTNs are interest-bearing, not discount, securities, and they pay on a
        corporate bond basis

*   **Difference to corporate bonds**
    *   Corporate bonds are underwritten, cost-effective
    *   MTNs are more flexible

## MUNICIPAL NOTES

*   **Definition**

    *   Debt securities issued by state and local governments and their
        authorities are referred to as municipal securities

*   **Two categories**

    *   General obligation (GO)
        *   by the credit of the issuer and are sold in anticipation of other
            funds, such as taxes
    *   Revenue bonds
        *   backed by the revenues generated by projects financed by the bond—
            such as hospitals, utilities, and airports

*   **Maturity**

    *   ranging from a month to a year
    *   Municipal bonds have maturities longer than a year

*   **Denomination**

    *   ranging anywhere from \$5,000 to \$5 million

*   **Advantages**

    *   tax exemption: interest income on most of them is exempt or at least
        partially exempt from fed- eral taxation

*   **Changes of Yield**
    *   depends upon its credit rating, the length of time for which it borrows,
        and the general level of short-term rates
    *   affected by changes in the tax code

## MORTGAGE-BACKED, PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES

*   Mortgage-backed, pass-through securities are a hybrid debt instrument

*   **Definition of Pass-through**

    *   Pass-through means that the cash flow from the underlying mortgages is
        passed through to the holders of the securities via monthly payments of
        interest and principal
    *   The sale of a pass-through security represents a sale of assets; thus a
        pass-through is not a debt obligation of the originator

*   **Advantages**

    *   perceived to carry little or no credit risk
    *   yield more than Treasuries of approximately similar maturity

*   **Types of Pass-through**

    *   **Ginnie Mae**

        *   Guaranteed by

            *   the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA)
                *   Guarantee the timely payment of interest and principal

        *   Insured by
            1.  Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
            2.  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
            3.  the Department of Agriculture’s Rural Housing Service (RHS)
            4.  Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Public
                and Indian Housing (PIH)

    *   **Freddie Mac**

        *   Guaranteed by
            *   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)
                *   Guarantees only the timely payment of interest and the
                    ultimate payment (within a year) of principal
        *   Based on:
            *   Freddie Macs are based on conventional mortgages: single-family
                resi- dential mortgages that are neither guaranteed by the VA
                nor insured by the FHA

    *   **Fannie Mae**

        *   Guaranteed by
            *   Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)
                *   Guarantee the timely payment of interest and principal

    *   **Private pass-throughs**
        *   the least important

# CHAPTER 4 Bond Valuation

*   Bonds are issued through auctions in which yields are bid
*   Typically, interest on bonds is paid to the holder semiannually on the
    coupon dates

*   **Bond**: Bonds are typically issued by the federal government,
    municipalities, or corporations as a way of raising money
*   **Bill**: A bond with a maturity, or life, of less than one year is called a
    bill

*   **Yield** $$P = \frac{A}{(1+r)^t}$$

    *   shows that there is an inverse relationship between the bond’s price and
        its yield

-   **Premium/Discount bond**

    *   if the coupon rate exceeds the yield, the bond will be a premium bond.
        If it equals the yield, it is a par bond. If it is less than the yield,
        it is a discount bond

-   **BOND EQUIVALENT YIELD**

    *   It therefore does not make sense to compare yields across bonds unless
        they are quoted at a common frequency. The convention is to quote a bond
        equivalent yield assuming semiannual compounding

-   **Expectations**

    *   By contrast, if interest rates are expected to decline (for example, the
        economy is entering a recession, and the Fed is expected to cut interest
        rates), the yield curve will be downward sloping

-   **Price Risk**

    *   A second reason for an upward sloping yield curve is that investing for
        the long run is riskier than investing for the short term
    *   Most investors are risk-averse; they will accept lower yields to obtain
        lower risk

-   **Basis point**

    *   Yield spreads between different securities are always measured in terms
        of basis points (bp)
    *   A basis point is 1/100 of 1 percentage point

-   **Roll Down**

    *   a bond’s yield will change as it “rolls down” the yield curve and
        approaches maturity and become another bond

-   **Price Volatility**

    *   the lower the coupon, the greater the percentage of change in price that
        will occur when rates rise or fall
    *   The reason for the greater percentage fall in the price of the
        low-coupon note is that principal repayment represents a greater
        proportion of total promised cash flows (principal plus coupon interest)
        on the low-coupon bond than on the high-coupon bond

-   **Call and Refunding Provisions**

    *   To protect investors making long-term commitments from frequent
        refundings by borrowers out to minimize interest costs, most bonds con-
        tain call and refunding provisions
    *   A bond issue is said to be callable when the issuer has the option to
        repay part or all of the issue early by paying some specified redemption
        price to bondholders

-   **Price Quotes**

    *   normally quoted as a percentage of face value
    *   a price of 97.994%, This percentage price is often called the bond’s
        **dollar price**.

-   **Clean Prices**

    *   quoted dollar prices always exclude any accrued interest: they are known
        as clean prices

-   **Dirty Prices**

    *   quoted dollar price plus any accrued interest: this is known as a full
        or dirty price

-   **Calendar Conventions**
    *   For corporate, municipal, or agency bonds, interest is accrued on a
        30/360 basis: as if each month has 30 days, and the year has 360 days.
