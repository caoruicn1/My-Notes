# PART I OVERVIEW, HISTORICAL RETURNS, AND ACADEMIC THEORIES 1

## 1. Introduction

- **Three Perspectives on investments and their expected returns**
    1. ASSET CLASSES
        - Equities, Government Bonds, Credits
    2. STRATEGY STYLES
        - Value, carry, momentum, and volatility styles
    3. RISK FACTORS
        - Growth, Inflation, Illiquidity, Tail risks (Volatility, Correlation, Return asymmetries)

### 1.1 Historical Performance

- **为何用 historical returns 来预测不可靠？**
    - Any sample period may be biased, 不具有代表性。
    - Distant historical data may be irrelevant.
    - Expected returns may vary over time in a cyclical fashion.
    - Investors Upward biased. 投资者倾向于价格会上涨。

- **Findings about historical performance**
    - 长期来看，Stock markets outperformed fixed income markets.
    - Among fixed income markets, long-term bonds outperformed short-dated
        bonds.
    - Illiquid assets offer higher long-run returns.
        - Corporate bodns VS. Treasuries.
        - Small-cap VS. Large-cap stock.

- **Other Finding:**
    - Value(overweighting assets that appear cheap based on some valuation metrics, while underweighting richly valued peers)
    - Carry(overweighting high-yielding assets while underweighting low-yielding assets)
    - Momentum(overweighting assets that have outperformed over multiple months while underweighting recent laggards)
    - 不一定高volatility就有高expected return。 这可能体现了 investor
        - Lottery-seeking bias(overpaying for the hope of jackpot returns)
        - Leverage constraints (overpaying for inherently volatile assets that give high bang for the buck for naive return seekers)

### 1.2 Financial and behavioral theories: A brief history of ideas

- **History**
    1. 1950s: Focus on predicting cash flows not on risk or required returns.
    2. Three decades: CAPM, the efficient market hypothesis, constant risk
       premia --explain asset prices and expected returns.

- **Theory**
    - Discount cash flows to the present value
    - Asset-pricing theory: 主要讨论如何确定discount rates or required returns.
    - Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): 风险完全由market beta决定，
      所以Investors can boosts retuns by bearing more beta risk.
    - 假设Expected returns为constant，则long-run average is a good estimate.

- **Highlight core ideas**
    - Two ways to earn: 1.bear risks, 2.pursue active management(reap peers)
    - The interrelations between factors matter. 负相关更好，可diversify.
    - Rewards来自多方面，mispricing，compensation for risk.
    - 风险与收益相关性ambiguous，因为 all volatility is not equal.
      每个asset背负不同的risk，只有systematic risks才能算premium，
      The reward for volatility can differ depending on which of several 
      systematic factors is the source of the volatility.
    - Assets or factors that perform poorly in "bad times" warrant high 
      required returns.
        - ![Return in bad time](what/Expected_return_1.png)
