# CHAPTER 1 The Problem of Risk

## The concept of Risk

- Current Definitions
	-  The outcome must be in question.
	-  At least one of the possible outcomes is

- **Our Definition**: a condition of the real world in which there is an exposure to adversity.
	- Risk is a condition in which there is a possibility of an adverse deviation from a desired outcome that is expected or hoped for.

## The Degree of Risk

- Degree of risk is related to the likelihood of occurrence. It is measured by the probability of the adverse deviation

## Risk Distinguished from Peril and Hazard

- The terms **peril** and **hazard** are commonly used interchangeably with each other and with risk.
- **A peril** is a cause of a loss.
- **A hazard**, on the other hand, is a condition that may create or increase the chance of a loss arising from a given peril.
	1. _Physical hazard_ consists of those physical properties that increase the chance of loss from the various perils.
	2. _Moral hazard_ refers to the increase in the probability of loss that results from dishonest tendencies in the character of the insured person.
	3. _Morale hazard_, not to be confused with moral hazard, acts to increase losses where insurance exists, not necessarily because of dishonesty but because of a different attitude toward losses that will be paid by insurance. 
	4. _Legal hazard_ refers to the increase in the frequency and severity of loss that arises from legal doctrines enacted by legislatures and created by the courts. 

## Classifications of Risk

### Static and Dynamic Risks

- **Dynamic risks** are those resulting from changes in the economy. 
	- a source of gain to society
	- less predictable.
- **Static risks** involve those losses that would occur even if there were no changes in the economy. 
	- not a source of gain to society
	- predictable

### Fundamental and Particular Risks

- **Fundamental risks** involve losses that are impersonal in origin and consequence.
- **Particular risks** involve losses that arise out of individual events and are felt by individuals rather than by the entire group.
- Based on the difference in the origin and consequences of the losses.

### Pure and Speculative Risks

- **Speculative risk** describes a situation in which there is a possibility of loss but also a possibility of gain.
- **Pure risk** is used to designate those situations that involve only the chance of loss or no loss.
	1. Personal risks
	2. Property risks
	3. Liability risks
	4. Risks arising from failure of others

### Systemic Risk

- **Systemic risk** refers to a risk that can affect an entire system, rather than just one entity.

# CHAPTER 2 Introduction to Risk Management

## ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

- **Enterprise risk management**: 
    - _Attempts to integrate the management of all of the firm’s pure and speculative risks._ 
    - Enterprise risk management, seeks to identify the risks facing the firm, 
      to quantify those risks, and to manage the risks efficiently consistent 
      with the firm’s strategic objectives.
- **Financial risk**
	- **Market risk** is the risk arising from adverse movements in market prices. 
	- **Credit risk** is the risk arising from the potential that a borrower will fail to pay a debt.
	- **Liquidity risk** is the risk that the business will have insufficient liquid assets to meet obligations that come due.
- **Operational risk** defined as the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events.
- **Reputational risk**: the potential that negative publicity will cause a loss.
- **Strategic risk**: the risk of failing to successfully implement the firm’s strategies
- **Compliance risk**: the risk of failing to comply with laws and regulations.

## RISK MANAGEMENT DEFINED
  
- **Risk management** is a scientific approach to dealing with risks by anticipating possible losses and designing and implementing procedures that minimize the occurrence of loss or the financial impact of the losses that do occur.

## RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS

- **Risk Control**
	- Risk control focuses on minimizing the risk of loss to which the firm is exposed and includes the techniques of avoidance and reduction.
	- **Risk Avoidance**
		- Prevent a risk from even coming into existence
	- **Risk Reduction**
		- designed to reduce the likelihood of loss or the potential severity of those losses that do occur.
- **Risk Financing**
	- Risk financing concentrates on arranging the availability of funds to 
    meet losses arising from the risks that remain after the application of 
    risk control techniques and includes the tools of retention and transfer.
	- **Risk Retention**
	- **Risk Transfer**

## RISK MANAGEMENT AS A BUSINESS FUNCTION

- Risk management can contribute directly to profit by controlling the cost of risk for the organization.
- Risk management can reduce expenses through risk control measures.
- Risk management can increase income.
- Risk management can permit an organization to engage in activities that 
  involve speculative risk by minimizing the pure risks associated with such ventures.

## MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT

- The **first** misconception is that the risk management concept is applicable principally to large organizations. 
- The **second** is that the risk management approach to dealing with pure risks seeks to minimize the role of insurance.
	
## THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

1. **Determination of objectives**
2. **Identification of risks**
	- *Risk Identification Techniques*
		1. Analysis of Documents
		2. Flowcharts
		3. InternalCommunicationSystem
	- *Tools of Risk Identification*
		1. Risk Analysis Questionnaires
		2. Exposure Checklists
		3. Insurance Policy Checklists
		4. Expert Systems
3. **Evaluation of risks**
	- *Criticality analysis*: an attempt to distinguish the important factors from the overwhelming mass of unimportant ones.
	- *Critical risks* include all exposures to loss in which the possible losses are of a magnitude that would result in bankruptcy.
    - *Important risks* include those exposures in which the possible losses would not result in bankruptcy but would require the firm to borrow in order to continue operations.
    - *Unimportant risks* include those exposures in which the possible losses could be met out of the existing assets or current income of the firm without imposing undue financial strain.
	- *The Loss Unit Concept*: The loss unit is the total of all financial losses that could result from a single event, taking into consideration the various exposures.
4. **Consideration of alternatives and selection of the risk treatment device**
5. **Implementation of the decision**
6. **Evaluation and review**
	- *Control requires three steps*:
		1. Setting standards or objectives to be achieved;
		2. Measuring performance against those standards and objectives;
		3. Taking corrective action when results differ from the intended results.
	- *Risk Management Audits*
		- A risk management audit is a detailed and systematic review of a 
        risk management program, designed to determine whether the objectives 
        of the program are appropriate to the needs of the organization, 
        whether the measures designed to achieve those objectives are suitable,
        and whether the measures have been properly implemented.

# CHAPTER 3 The Insurance Device

## THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF INSURANCE

- **Risk Sharing and Risk Transfer**
	1. Transferring or shifting risk from one individual to a group
    2. Sharing losses, on some equitable basis, by all members of the group

- _**Insurance from the Viewpoint of the Individual**_
	- **Definition**: Insurance is an economic device whereby the individual substitutes a small certain cost (the premium) for a large uncertain financial loss (the contingency insured against) that would exist if it were not for the insurance.
	- **PPT**
		- The **primary function** of insurance is the creation of the counterpart of risk, which  is security.
        - Insurance **does not decrease the uncertainty** for the individual as to whether the event will occur, nor does it alter the probability of occurrence.
        - Insurance **does reduce the probability**  of financial  loss connected with the event.

- **Risk Reduction Through Pooling**
	- The risk an insurer faces is not merely a summation of risks transferred to it by individuals.
    - Insurer can predict within narrow limits the amount of losses that will occur.
    - If insurer could predict future losses with absolute precision, it would have no risk.
    - Accuracy of insurer’s prediction is based on **the law of large numbers**.
- **Probability Theory and Law of Large Numbers**
	- Probability theory is the body of knowledge concerned with measuring the likelihood that something will happen and making predictions based on this likelihood.
    - **Two Interpretations of Probability**
        1.	**Relative frequency interpretation** signifies the relative frequency of occurrence expected, given a large number of separate independent trials.
        2.	**Subjective interpretation**probability is measured by the degree of belief  (e.g., a student says she has a 50:50 chance of getting a B in a course).
    - **Posteriori Probabilities**
        - These probabilities,computed after a study of past experience, are called a posteriori or empirical probabilities.


- _**Insurance Defined from the Viewpoint of Society**_
	- From the social point of view, insurance is an economic device for 
    reducing and eliminating risk through the process of combining a sufficient 
    number of homogeneous exposures into a group to make the losses predictable 
    for the group as a whole.

## ELEMENTS OF AN INSURABLE RISK

1. There must be a sufficiently large number of homogeneous exposure units to make the losses reasonably predictable. 
2. The loss produced by the risk must be definite and measurable. 
3. The loss must be fortuitous or accidental. 
4. The loss must not be catastrophic. 


## THE FIELDS OF INSURANCE

- **Private (Voluntary) Insurance**
	1. Life insurance
    2. Health insurance
    3. Property and liability insurance
        - voluntary programs designed to protect individual against financial loss	
        - Usually (but not always) voluntary.
        - Usually (but not always) offered by private insurers.	

- **Social Insurance**
	- compulsory insurance programs generally operated by government

- **Public Benefit Guarantee Programs**
	- quasi-social coverages usually associated with regulation.

- **Federal Public Guarantee Insurance Programs**
	- Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation	- National Credit Union Administration	- Securities Investor Protection Corporation	- Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation

# CHAPTER 4 Risk Management Applicationss

## RISK MANAGEMENT DECISIONS

- **Utility Theory**
	- The theory of marginal utility was constructed by economists in an attempt to explain why people make the consumer choices they do.

- **Decision Theory**
	- The decision theory approach aims at identifying the best deci- sion or solution to the problem.

- **The Rules of Risk Management**
	- Don’t Risk More Than You Can Afford to Lose
	- Consider the Odds
	- Don’t Risk a Lot for a Little

- **A Priority Ranking for Insurance Expenditures**
	- **Essential insurance** coverages include those de- signed to protect against loss exposures that could result in bankruptcy. Insurance coverage required by law is also essential.	- **Important insurance** coverages include those that protect against loss exposures that would force the insured to borrow or resort to credit.	- **Optional insurance** coverages include those that protect against losses that could be met out of existing assets or current income.

- **Large-Loss Principle**: Essential Coverages First
- **Insurance as a Last Resort**: Optional Coverages


# CHAPTER 5 The Private Insurance Industry

## CLASSIFICATION OF PRIVATE INSURERS

- **Classification by Type of Product**
	- *Life insurance* companies sell life insurance, annuities and health insurance
	- *Property and liability insurance* companies market all forms of property and liability insurance (including health insurance) but do not write life insurance.


- **Classification by Place of Incorporation and Licensing**
	- A *domestic* insurer & A *foreign* insurer
	- A *licensed* (or admitted) insurer & An *unlicensed* (or nonadmitted) insurer

- **Insurers Classification by Legal Form of Ownership**
	1. Capital stock insurance companies	2. Mutual insurance companies	3. Reciprocals or interinsurance exchanges 
	4. Lloyd’s associations	5. Health expense associations	6. Government insurers

- **Reasons for Government Insurance**
	- Fundamental risks that require compulsion and lack equity	- Hazard considered too great by private insurance	- Adverse selection against private insurersTools of social change by government	- Mistaken notion that government can repeal the law of averages
## MARKETING SYSTEMS

- **Distinction Between Agent and Broker**
	- **Agent:** an individual authorized by an insurer to create, modify, and terminate contracts of insurance.	- **Broker:** a representative of the insured who solicits business from insurance buyers but who is compensated by the insurer.	- The agent can “bind” an insurer to a risk.	- A broker does not have binding authority.
- **Corporate Combinations**
	- Insurance company groups or fleets		- Originally formed in monoline era to combine property and casualty coverages	- Underwriting syndicates		- Insurers join together to handle risks that would be beyond the capacity of an individual company 		- An example is US Aircraft Insurance Group, which offers insurance for aviation risks

## COMPETITION IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

- **Price Competition**
	- Insurance companies compete on the basis of price by attempting to offer a lower priced product than other companies dealing in the same line of insurance.
	- occurs  primarily at the company level

- **Costs Common to All Insurers**
	1.	Losses and loss adjustment expense	2.	Acquisition expense	3.	Administrative expense (company overhead)	4.	Taxes	5.	Profit and contingencies- **Quality Competition**
	- Insurance companies compete by offering broader forms of coverage and prompt claim service. 
	- occurs primarily at the agency or brokerage level


- **Evidence of Intensity of Competition**
	1. Industry is highly cyclical, indicating inability to control output, prices, or profits.	2. Profits in recent years have consistently been below those for most industries.	3. Recurring insurer insolvencies indicate an intense degree of price competition.

# CHAPTER 7 Functions of Insurers

- **Financial aspects of operations**
	1. Ratemaking	2. Production	3. Underwriting	4. Loss adjustment 
	5. Investment

## RATEMAKING

- **Definition**
	- The process of predicting future losses and future expenses and allocating these costs among the various classes of insureds is called **ratemaking**.


- **Some Basic Concepts**
	- **rate**
		- A *rate* is the price charged for each unit of protec- tion or exposure and should be distinguished from a *premium*, which is determined by multiplying the rate by the number of units of protection purchased.
	- **final premium**
		- The *final premium* the insured pays is called the *gross premium* and is based on a *gross rate*.
	- **gross rate** is composed of two parts
		1. one that provides for the payment of losses.
		2. one that called a **loading**, that covers the expenses of operation.
			- Commissions			- Other acquisition expenses			- General administrative expenses
			- Premium taxes			- Allowance for contingencies and profit

	-  That part of the rate intended to cover losses is called the **pure premium** when expressed in dollars and cents, and the **expected loss ratio** when expressed as a percentage.

	- **permissible loss ratio**: $1-Expense\ Ratio$

$$Pure\ premium = \frac{Losses}{Exposure\ Units}$$
$$ Gross\ Rate = \frac{Pure\ Premium}{1-Expense\ Ratio} $$

- **Types of Rates**
	1. **Class Rates**
		- The term class rating refers to the practice of computing a price per unit of insurance that applies *to all* applicants possessing a given set of characteristics
	2. **Individual Rates**
		- Measure *more precisely* the loss-producing characteristics of the individual.
		- *Four basic individual rating approaches*
			- Judgment Rating
			- Schedule Rating
			- Experience Rating
				- $Modification = \frac{Actual\ Loss\ Ratio - Expected\ Loss\ Ratio}{Expected\ Loss\ Ratio} \times Credibility\ Factor$
			- Retrospective Rating
		- **Credibility factor**
			- reflects the degree of confidence the ratemakers believe they should attach to past losses as predic- tors of future losses.
		
	
	- *Catastrophe modeling* (also called cat modeling) uses computer simulations based on experience and the insurer’s known distribution of insured property.



## PRODUCTION

- The **production** department of an insurance com- pany, sometimes called the agency department, is its sales or marketing division.


## UNDERWRITING

- **Underwriting** is the process of selecting and clas- sifying exposures. 

- **Underwriter**
	- refers to an agent

- **Process of Underwriting**
	1. Application containing the insured’s statements 
	2. Information from the agent or broker
	3. Information from external agencies 
	4. Physical examinations or inspections

- **Postselection Underwriting**
	- **Postselection (or renewal) underwriting**, in which the insurer decides if the insurance should be continued.

- **Credit Scoring**


## LOSS ADJUSTMENT

- **Adjustment Process**
	1. Notice of Loss
	2. Investigation
	3. Proof of Loss
	4. Payment or Denial

## THE INVESTMENT FUNCTION

- insurance companies accumulate large amounts of money for the payment of claims in the future and to manage on behalf of others

## MISCELLANEOUS FUNCTIONS

- Legal
- Accounting
- Engineering


# CHAPTER 8 Financial Aspects Of Insurer Operations

## STATUTORY ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

- The set of accounting procedures embraced by insurance regulators is referred to as the statutory accounting system because it is required by the statutes of the various states.

- **Differences Between Statutory Accounting and GAAP**
	1. criteria for inclusion of assets in the balance sheet
		- *Admitted Assets* 
			- Assets that readily convertible into cash.
		- *Nonadmitted Assets* 
			- Assets such as supplies, furniture and fixtures, office machines and equipment, and premiums past due 90 days or more
	2. Valuation of Assets
	3. Matching of Revenues and Expenses

- **Terminology**
	- **Policyholder’s Surplus**
		- The equity section of the balance sheet for any business consists of the excess of asset values over the liabilities of the firm.
	- **Reserves**
		- The major liabilities of insurance com- panies are debts to policyholders; they are called reserves.


## PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURERS

- **Concept of Earned Premiums**
	- First, insurers are permitted to include premiums as income only as the premiums become earned, that is, only as the time for which protection is provided passes.
	- Second, the insurer is required to establish a deferred income account as a liability, called the *unearned premium reserve*, the primary purpose of which is to place a claim against assets that will presumably be required to pay losses occurring in the future.

- **Unearned Premium Reserve**
	- The unearned premium reserve represents the premiums that insureds have paid in advance for the unexpired terms of their outstanding policies
	- insurance company enters them as a liability on its books

- **Incurred Losses & Paid losses**
	- **Incurred losses** refer to those losses taking place during the particular period under consideration, regardless of when they are paid
	- **Paid losses** refer to losses paid during a particular period regardless of the time that the loss occurred.
	- The *difference* between paid and incurred losses is recog- nized through liability accounts called loss or claim reserves.
	- *Two types ofLoss Reserves*
		1. a reserve for losses reported but not paid
		2. a reserve for losses that have occurred but have not been reported to the insurance company.

- **Two sources of profit or contribution to surplus**
	1. Underwriting gains 
	2. Investments

- **The Combined Ratio**
	- Combined ratio, which is derived by adding the **loss ratio** and the **expense ratio** for the period under consideration
	- **The loss ratio**
		- The loss ratio is computed by dividing losses incurred during the year by premiums earned
	- **The expense ratio**
		- The expense ratio is computed by dividing expenses incurred by premi- ums written.


## REINSURANCE

- **Types of Reinsurance Treaties**
	1. Facultative
		- the risks are considered individually by both parties
	2. Automatic
		- the reinsurer agrees in advance to accept a portion of the gross line of the direct writing company or a portion of certain risks that meet the reinsurance underwriting rules of the reinsurer.


- **Functions of Reinsurance**
	1. the spreading of risk
	2. It is a financial function
