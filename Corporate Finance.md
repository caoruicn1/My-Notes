# PART 1 Introduction
## CHAPTER 1 The Corporation

* **Four Types of Firms**
	* Sole Proprietorships: Owned and run by one person
	* Partnerships：More than one person，Limited partnership (no management authority) & General partnership
	* Limited Liability Companies**(LLC)**: All Limited partnership(can run)
	* Corporations: Artificial being, no limitation - Number&Owner
		1. S Corporations, exempt 
		2. C Corporations, double

* **Ownership Versus Control of Corporations**
	* Board of directors
	* Chief executive officer**(CEO)**: Charged with running the corporation by instituting the rules and policies set by the board of directors.
	* Chief financial officer**(CFO)**: Investment Decisions, Financing Decisions, Cash Management.
	* Agency Problems: managers put their own self-interest ahead 
	* Hostile takeover: purchase a large fraction of the stock and acquire enough votes
	* Corporate Bankruptcy: *A change in ownership of the corporation*, not a failure
 
* **The Stock Market**
	* Private companies & Public companies
	* Primary market & Secondary market 
	* NYSE(one market maker) & NASDAQ(more than one)

<span id="2"></span>
## CHAPTER 2 Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis
* **Firms' Disclosure of Financial information**
	* Preparation Financial Statements: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles(GAAP), Auditor
		1. Balance sheet
		2. Income statement
		3. Statement of cash flows
		4. Statement of stockholders' equity

* **The Balance Sheet**: $$Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity$$
	* Assets
		1. Current Assets: Cash and other marketable securities, Accounts receivable, Inventories, Other current assents 
		2. Long-Term Assets: net property, plant and equipment(depreciation), Goodwill and intangible assets(amortization or impairment charge), Other long-term assets
	* Liability
		1. Current Liabilities: Accounts payable, Short-term debt, owed but not paid, deferred or unearned revenue
		2. Long-term Liabilities: Long-term debt, Capital leases, Deferred taxes
	* Stockholders' Equity / Book value of equity ~historical & not captured
	* $$Market\ Value\ of\ Equity("Market\ Cap") = Shares\ outstanding \times Market\ price\ per\ share$$
	* $$Enterprise\ Value(TEV) = Market\ Value\ of\ Equity + Debt - Cash$$
	* Net working capital: Difference between current assets and current liability, the capital available in the short term to run the business

* **The Income Statement**(Statement of financial performance)
	* Gross Profit, Operating Expenses, Earnings before interest and Taxes**(EBIT)**, Pretax Income & Net Income
	* $$Earning\ per\ share(EPS) = \frac{Net\ Income}{Share\ Outstanding}$$

* **The Statement of Cash Flows**
	* Operating activities: +depreciation and amortization, +non-cash expenses, Cash effect of changes in **-Accounts receivable, +Accounts payable, -Inventory**  
	* Investment activities: -Capital expenditures, -Acquisitions and other investing activities
	* Financing activities: -Dividends, Sale(or purchase)of stock, +Increase in borrowing 
	* $$Retained\ Earnings = Net\ Income - Dividends$$

* Change in Stockholders' Equity = Retained Earnings + Net sales of stock = Net Income - Dividends + Sales of stock - Repurchases of stock

* **Management discussion and analysis(MD&A)**: disclose any off-balance sheet transactions
* EBIT：earnings before interest and tax。

* **Financial Statement Analysis**
	* **Profitability Ratio**
		1. $Gross\ Margin = \frac{Gross\ Profit}{Sales}$
		1. $Operating\ Margin = \frac{Operating\ Income}{Sales}$
		1. $EBIT\ margin = \frac{EBIT}{Sales}$
		1. $Net\ Profit\ Margin = \frac{Net\ Income}{Sales}$
	* **Liquidity Ratios**
		1. $Current\ Ratio = \frac{Current\ Assets}{Current\ Liabilities}$
		1. $Quick\ Ratio = \frac{Cash\ \&\ Short\text{-}term\ Investments + Accounts\ Receivable}{Current\ Liabilities}$
		1. $Cash\ Ratio = \frac{Cash}{Current\ Liabilities}$
	* **Working Capital Ratios**
		1. $Accounts\ Receivable\ Days = \frac{Accounts\ Receivable}{Average\ Daily\ Sales}$
		1. $Accounts\ Payable\ Days = \frac{Accounts\ Payable}{Average\ Daily\ Cost\ of\ Sales}$
		1. $Inventory\ Days =  \frac{Inventory}{Average\ Daily\ Cost\ of\ Sales}$
		1. $Accounts\ Receivable\ Turnover = \frac{Annual\ Sales}{Accounts\ Receivable}$
		1. $Accounts\ Payable\ Turnover = \frac{Annual\ Cost\ of\ Sales}{Accounts\ Payable}$
		1. $Inventory\ Turnover = \frac{Annual\ Cost\ of\ Sales}{Inventory}$
	* **Interest Coverage Ratio**
		1. $EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation\ and\ Amortization$
		1. $EBIT/Interest\ Coverage = \frac{EBIT}{Interest\ Expense}$
		1. $EBITDA/Interest\ Coverage = \frac{EBITDA}{Interest\ Expense}$
	* **Leverage Ratios**
		1. $Debt\text{-}Equity\ Ratio = \frac{Total\ Debt}{Total\ Equity}$
		1. $Debt\text{-}to\text{-}Capital\ Ratio = \frac{Total\ Debt}{Total\ Equity + Total\ Debt}$
		1. $Net\ Debt = Total\ Debt - Excess\ Cash\ \&\ Short\text{-}term\ Investments$
		1. $Debt\text{-}to\text{-}Enterprise\ Value\ Ratio = \frac{Net\ Debt}{Market\ Value\ of\ Equity + Net\ Debt}$
		1. $Equity\ Multiplier(book) = \frac{Total\ Assets}{Book\ Value\ of\ Equity}$
		1. $Equity\ Multiplier(market) = \frac{Enterprise Value}{Market\ Value\ of\ Equity}$
	* **Valuation Ratios**
		1. $Market\text{-}to\text{-}Book\ Ratio(P/B\ ratio) = \frac{Market\ Value\ of\ Equity}{Book\ Value\ of\ Equity}$
		1. $Price\text{-}Earnings\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Capitalization}{Net\ Income} = \frac{Share\ Price}{Earnings\ per\ Share}$
		1. $Enterprise\ Value\ Ratios = \frac{Enterprise\ Value}{EBIT\ or\ EBITDA\ or\ Sales}$
	* **Operating Returns**
		1. $Asset\ Turnover = \frac{Sales}{Total\ Assets}$
		2. $Return\ on\ Equity(ROE) = \frac{Net\ Income}{Book\ Value\ of\ Equity}$
		3. $Return\ on\ Assets(ROA)= \frac{Net\ Income + Interest\ Expense}{Book\ Value\ of\ Assets}$
		4. $Return\ on\ Invested\ Capital(ROIC) = \frac{EBIT(1-Tax\ Rate)}{Book\ Value\ of\ Equity + Net\ Debt}$

* **Financial Reporting in Practice** 
	* **Sarbanes-Oxley Act(SOX)** & **Dodd-Frank Act**
	* Fraud 1: Sold assets with a promise to buy back at an even higher future price.
	* Fraud 2: Reclassify money in operating expenses as long-term capital expenditures. Because then operating expenses are deducted from earnings immediately and capital expenditures are depreciated slowly over time. It boost the reported earnings but not cash flow because long-term investments must be deducted in cash flow statement.

<span id="3"></span>
## CHAPTER 3 Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
* **Important Concept:**
	* Law of one price, NPV Decision Rule, Separation Principle
	* Competitive market
	* Time value of Money
	* Risk-free interest rate, interest rate factor
	* Discount rate, discount factor
	* Present value(PV), Future value(FV), Net present value(NPV)
	* $Net\ Present\ Value = PV(Benefits) - PV(Costs) = PV(All\ project\ cash\ flows)$
	* Arbitrage, Arbitrage opportunity, Normal market, 
	* No-Arbitrage Price, $Price(Security) = PV(All\ cash\ flows\ paid\ by\ the\ security)$
	* Value Additivity, $Price( C )= Price(A+B) = Price(A)+ Price(B)$
	* Risk Aversion, transactions Costs
	* $Expected\ return\ of\ a\ risky\ investment = \frac{Expected\ gain\ at\ end\ of\ year}{Initial\ cost}$
	* Risk Premium: $r_s = r_f + (risk\ premium\ for\ investment\ S)$

<span id="4"></span>
#PART 2 Time, Money and Interest Rate
## CHAPTER 4 The Time Value of Money
* **The Timeline**: Stream of cash flows, timeline
* **The Three Rules of Time Travel**
	* Comparing and Combining Values
	* Moving CashFlows Forward in Time: Compounding
	* Moving Cash Flows Back in Time: discounting
* Future Value of a Cash Flow: $FV_n = C \times (1 + r)^n$
* Present of a Cash Flow: $PV = \frac{C}{(1 + r)^n}$
* Present Value of a Cash Flow Stream: $PV = \sum_{n=0}^N PV(C_n) =\sum_{n=0}^N \frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n}$

* **Perpetuities(Consols) and Annuities**
	* Present Value of a Perpetuity: $PV(C\ in\ perpetuity) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{C}{(1+r)^n}  = \frac{C}{r}$
	* Present Value of an Annuity: $$PV(annuity\ of\ C\ for\ N\ periods) = \sum_{n=1}^N C(1- \frac{1}{(1+r)^N})  = \frac{C}{r} (1- \frac{1}{(1+r)^N})$$
	* Future Value of an Annuity: $FV(annuity) = PV \times (1 + r)^N = \frac{C}{r} ((1+r)^N - 1)$
	* Present Value of a Growing Perpetuity: $PV(growing\ perpetuity) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{C(1 + g)^{n-1}}{(1+r)^n} =\frac{C}{r - g}$
	* Present Value of a Growing Annuity: $PV =C \times \frac{1}{r - g}(1- (\frac{1+g}{1+r})^N)$
	* **Excel:** FV(RATE,NPER,PMT,PV), *PMT*(RATE,*NPER*,PV,FV)
	* $NPV = PV + PMT \times \frac{1}{RATE}(1-\frac{1}{(1+RATE)^{NPER}})+\frac{FV}{(1+RATE)^{NPER}} = 0$
	
* **Solving for the Cash Payments**
	* Loan or Annuity Payment(PMT): $C = \frac{P}{\frac{1}{r}(1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^N})}$
* **The Internal Rate of Return(IRR)**
	* $IRR\ with\ two\ cash\ flows = (\frac{FV}{P})^{1/N}-1$
	* $IRR\ of\ growing\ perpetuity = \frac{C}{P}+g$

<span id="5"></span>
## CHAPTER 5 Interest Rates
* **Interest Rate Quotes and Adjustments**
	* Effective Annual Rate**(EAR)**: The actual amount of interest that will be earned at the end of one year.
	* $Equivalent\ n\text{-}Period\ Discount\ Rate = (1+r)^n - 1$
	* Annual Percentage Rate**(APR)**: The amount of *simple interest* earned in one year.
		* $Interest\ Rate\ per\ Compounding\ Period = \frac{APR}{K\ periods\ /\ per\ year}$
		* Converting an APR to an EAR: $1 + EAR = (1 + \frac{APR}{k})^k$
		* **The Determinants of Interest Rates**
	* Nominal Interest Rates($r$) & Real Interest Rate, Inflation($i$)
	* $Growth\ in\ Purchasing\ Power = 1+r_r = \frac{1+r}{1+i} = \frac{Growth\ of\ Money}{Growth\ of\ Prices}$
	* $The\ Real\ Interest\ Rate: r_r = \frac{r-i}{1+i}\approx r-i$
	* The relationship between the investment term and the interest rate is called the **term structure** of interest rates. Its graph called **yield curve**.
	* The Federal Reserve determines very short-term interest rates through its influence on the **federal funds rate**, which is the rate at which banks can borrow cash reserves on an overnight basis.
	* **Interest Rate Expectations**: if it's expected rise, long-term > short-term
* **Risk and Taxes**
	* *Specially, the right discount rate for a cash flow is the rate of return available in the market on other investments of comparable risk and term.*
	* **After-Tex Interest Rate**: $r-(t\times r) = r(1-t)$
* **The Opportunity Cost of Capital**: the best available expected return offered in the market on an investment of comparable risk and term to the cash flow being discounted.
* **The EAR for a Continuously Compounded APR**: $(1+EAR)=e^{APR}$
* **The Continuously Compounded APR for an EAR**: $APR=ln(1+EAR)$
* **Present Value of a Continuously Growing Perpetuity**: $$PV=\frac{C}{r_{cc}-g_{cc}}\\ r_{cc}=ln(1+r),\ g_{cc}=ln(1+g)$$
* **Mid-year convention** pretend that all of the cash flows for the year arrive in the middle of the year. $\overline{C_1}$ is the total cash flows that arrive during the first year.  $$\frac{C}{r_{cc}-g_{cc}}\approx \frac{\overline{C_1}}{r-g}\times (1+r)^{1/2}$$

<span id="6"></span>
## CHAPTER 6: Valuing Bonds
* **Bond Cash Flows, Prices, and Yields**
	* bond certificate, maturity date, term, coupons, face value, coupon rate
	* **Coupon Payment**: $CPN = \frac{Coupon\ Rate\times Face\ Value}{Number\ of\ coupon\ Payments\ per\ Year}$
	* Zero-coupon bond(pure discount bonds), Coupon bonds~(Treasury notes, Treasury bills, Treasury bonds)
	* **Yield to maturity(YTM)**
		* **Yield to Maturity of an n-Year Zero-Coupon Bond**: $YTM_n=(\frac{FV}{P})^{1/n}-1$
		* **Yield to Maturity of a Coupon Bond**: $P=CPN\times \frac{1}{y}(1-\frac{1}{(1+y)^N})+\frac{FV}{(1+y)^N}$

* **Dynamic Behavior of Bond Prices**
	* at a discount/premium, par
	* *${\cal As\ interest\ rates\ and\ bond\ yields\ rise, bond\ prices\ will\ fall, and\ vice\ versa.}$*

* **Valuing a Coupon Bond Using Zero-Coupon Yields**
	* Use the zero-coupon yield curve to determine the price and yield to maturity of other risk-free bonds.
	* **Price of a Coupon Bond**: $$P=PV(Bond\ Cash\ Flows)=\frac{CPN}{1+YTM_1}+\frac{CPN}{1+YTM_2}+ \ldots +\frac{CPN+FV}{(1+YTM_n)^n}$$
	* The plot of yields of coupon bonds of different maturities is called the **coupon-paying yield curve**.
	* The most recently issued bonds, termed the **on-the-run bonds**.
* **Corporate Bonds**
	* Default(credit risk), *The YTM of a default-able bond exceeds the expected return of investing*
	* Default Free / 50% Chance of Default / Certain Default
	* More risk, less expected return. Higher yield $\neq$ Higher yield

* **Bond Ratings**
	* Investment Grade Debt: Aaa/AAA, Aa/AA, A/A, Baa/BBB
	* Speculative Bonds: Ba/BB, B/B, Caa/CCC, Ca/CC, C/C, D
	* Default spread(Credit Spread) is the difference between corporate and Treasury yield
* **Sovereign bonds**
	* **Sovereign bonds** are issued by national governments.
	* In Eurozone, the other countries are suffered and pay for the default country because of printing more money.

* **Forward Interest Rates** 
	* It means the compound rate of the interest.
	* $(1+ YTM_n)^n = (1+ YTM_{n-1})^n-1(1+ f_n)$
	* $f_n= \frac{(1+ YTM_n)^n}{(1+ YTM_{n-1})^n-1} -1$
	* **Computing Bonds Yields from Forward Rates**: $(1+f_1)\times (1+f_2)\times \ldots (1+f_n) = (1+ YTM_n)^n$
	* $Expected\ Future\ Spot\ Interest\ Rate = Forward\ Interest\ Rate + Risk\ Premium$

<span id="7"></span>
# PART 3 Valuing Projects and Firms
## CHAPTER 7 Investment Decision Rules
* **NPV and Stand-Alone Projects**
	* **NPV Investment Rule**:  When making an investment decision, take the alternative with the highest NPV. Choosing this alternative is equivalent to receiving its NPV in cash today.
	* $NPV=PV(Cost)+ \frac{PMT}{r}$
	* **NPV Profile**: a graph of the project's NPV over a range of discount rates.

* **The Internal Rate of Return Rule**
	* **IRR Investment Rule**: Take any investment opportunity where the IRR exceeds the opportunity cost of capital. Turn down any opportunity whose IRR is less than the opportunity cost of capital. 
	* **IRR Rule Pitfall**，only rely on the NPV rule
		1. Delayed Investment
			* No matter what the cost of capital is, the IRR rule and the NPV rule will give exactly opposite recommendations
			* In this case, Star gets cash **upfront** and incurs the costs of producing the book **later**. It is as if Star **borrowed money**—receiving cash today in exchange for a future liability—and when you borrow money you prefer as low a rate as possible.
		2. Multiple IRRs
		3. Nonexistent IRR
			* There is no discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero.

* **The Payback Rule**
	* You should only accept a project if its cash flows pay back its initial investment within a pre-specified period. (Pay back period)
	* **Not reliable**
		* (1) Ignores the project’s cost of capital and the time value of money.
		* (2) Ignores cash flows after the payback period.
		* (3) Relies on an ad hoc decision criterion (what is the right number of years to require for the payback period?)

* **Choosing Between Projects**
	* Highest NPV
	* Use IRR to compare investment opportunities when they have the same scale, timing, and risk.
	* Incremental IRR: the difference between the cash flows of the two alternatives.

* **Profitability Index**
	* $Profitability\ Index= \frac{Value\ Created}{Resource\ Consumed}=\frac{NPV}{Resource\ Consumed}$
	* Necessary conditions: exhausted, single relevant resource constraint.

<span id="8"></span>
## CHAPTER 8 Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
* **Forecasting Earnings**
	* **Capital budget**: lists the projects and investments that a company plans to undertake during the coming year.
	* **Incremental earnings**: the amount by which the firm's earnings are expected to change as a result of the investment decision.
	* **Straight-line depreciation**: the asset's cost divided equally over its estimated useful life.
	* $$\begin{align} Unlevered\ Net\ Income & = EBIT\times (1-\tau_c) \\ & = (Revenues - Costs - Depreciation)\times (1-\tau_c) \end{align}$$

* **Determining Free Cash Flow and NPV**
	* $\begin{align}Net\ working\ capital(NWC) & = Current\ Assets-Current\ Liabilities \\ & = Cash+Inventory+Receivables-Payables \end{align}$
	* $\begin{align} Free\ Cash\ Flow & = \overbrace{(Revenues-Costs-Depreciation)\times (1-\tau_c)}^{Unlevered\ Net\ Income} \\ & + Depreciation - CapEx - 	\Delta NWC \\& = (Revenues-Costs)\times (1-\tau_c) - CapEx - 	\Delta NWC + Depreciation \times \tau_c \end{align}$
		* $Depreciation \times \tau_c$ is called the **depreciation tax shield**. It has *positive* impact on free cash flow.
		* $Capital\ Expenditures$
	* $PV(FCF_t)=\frac{FCF_t}{(1+r)^t} = FCF_t \times \frac{1}{\underbrace{(1+r)^t}_{t-year\ discount\ factor}}$
* **Choosing Among Alternatives**
	* Comparing **NPV** and **Free Cash Flows**.
* **Further Adjustments to Free Cash Flow**
	* Other Non-Cash Items
	* Timing of Cash Flows
	* Accelerated Depreciation
		* Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System(MACRS) depreciation: the firm first categorizes assets according to their recovery period. Based on the recovery period, MACRS depreciation tables assign a fraction of the purchase price that the firm can recover each year.
	* Liquidation or Salvage Value
		* Assets that are no longer needed often have a resale value, or some salvage value if the parts are sold for scrap.
		* $Gain\ on\ Sale = Sale\ Price-Book\ Value$
		* $Book\ Value = Purchase\ Price-Accumulated\ Depreciation$
		* $After\text{-}Tex\ Cash\ Flow\ from\ Asset\ Sale=Sale\ Price-(\tau_c \times Gain\ on\ Sale)$
	* Terminal or Continuation Value
		* It's common to explicitly calculate free cash flow over a short horizon, and then assume that cash flows grow at some constant rate beyond the forecast horizon.
	* Tax Carryforwards
		* When a firm can **carry back losses**, it receives a refund for back taxes in the current year. Otherwise, the firm must **carry forward the loss** and use it to offset future taxable income. When a firm has **tax loss carryforwards** well in excess of its current pretax income, then additional income it earns today will not increase the taxes it owes until after it exhausts its **carryforwards**. This delay reduces the present value of the tax liability.

* **Analyzing the Project**
	* Break-Even Analysis
		* It is the level for which the investment has an **NPV of zero**.
		* **Parameter**: Units sold, Wholesale price, Cost of goods, Cost of capital.
	* Sensitivity Analysis
		* It breaks the NPV calculation into its component assumptions and shows how the NPV varies as the underlying **assumptions change**.
		* _Initial Assumption_ & _Worst Case_ & _Best Case_.
	* Scenario Analysis
		* It considers the effect on the NPV of changing multiple project parameters
			* Current strategy: Sale price, Expected Units Sold, NPV
			* Price reduction: Sale price, Expected Units Sold, NPV
			* Price Increase: Sale price, Expected Units Sold, NPV

<span id="9"></span>
## CHAPTER 9 Valuing Stocks

* **The Dividend-Discount Model**
	* $r_E=\frac{Div_1+P_1}{P_0}-1=\underbrace{\frac{Div_1}{P_0}}_{Dividend\ yield}+\underbrace{\frac{P_1-P_0}{P_0}}_{Capital\ Gain\ Rate}$
	* $P_0=\frac{Div_1}{1+r_E}+\frac{Div_2}{(1+r_E)^2}+\dots +\frac{Div_N}{(1+r_E)^N}+\frac{P_N}{(1+r_E)^N}$
* **Applying the Dividend-Discount Model**
	* $P_0=\frac{Div_1}{r_E-g}$
	* $Div_t=\underbrace{\frac{Earnings_t}{Shares\ Outstanding_t}}_{EPS_t} \times Dividend\ Payout\ Rate_t$
	* $g=Retention\ Rate \times Return\ on\ New\ Investment$
* **Total Payout and Free Cash Flow Valuation Models**
	* $P_0=\frac{PV(Future\ Total\ Dividends\ and\ Repurchases)}{Shares\ Outstanding_0}$
	* $\begin{align}Free\ Cash\ Flow &= EBIT\times (1-\tau_c)-Net\ Investment \\ & - Increases\ in\ Net\ Working\ Capital \end{align}$
	* $V_0=PV(Future\ Free\ Cash\ Flow\ of\ Firm)$
	* $P_0=\frac{V_0+Cash_0-Debt_0}{Shares\ Oustanding_0}$
* **Valuation Based on Comparable Firms**
* **Information, Competition, and Stock Prices**

<span id="10"></span>
# PART 4 Risk and Return
## CHAPTER 10 Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk

* **A First Look at Risk and Return**
* **Common Measures of Risk and Return**
	* $Expected\ Return= E[R]= \sum_R p_R \times R$
	* $Var(R)= E[(R-E[R])^2]=\sum_R p_R \times (R-E[R])^2$
	* $SD(R)=\sqrt{Var(R)}$
* **Historical Returns of Stocks and Bonds**
	* $\overline{R}=\frac{1}{T}(R_1+R_2+\dots +R_T)=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} R_t$
	* $Var(R)=\frac{1}{1-T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(R_t-\overline{R})^2$
	* $SD(Average\ of\ Independent, Identical\ Risks)= \frac{SD (Individual\ Risk)}{\sqrt{Number\ of\ Observations}}$
* **The Historical Trade-Off Between Risk and Return**
* **Common Versus Independent Risk**
* **Diversification in Stock Portfolios**
* **Measuring Systematic Risk**
* **Beta and the Cost of Capital**
	* $Market\ Risk\ Premium= E[R_{Mkt}]-r_f$
	* $r_I=r_f+\beta \times (E[R_{Mkt}]-r_f)$


<span id="11"></span>
## CHAPTER 11 Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model

* **The Expected Return of a Portfolio**
	* $x_i=\frac{Value\ of\ investment\ i}{Total\ Value\ of\ portfolio}$
	* $E[]R_p=\sum_{i}x_iE[R_i]$
* **The Volatility of a Two-Stock Portfolio**
	* $Cov(R_i,R_j)=E[(R_i-E[R_i])(R_j-E[R_i])]$
	* $Cov(R_i,R_j)=\frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t}(R_{i,t}-\overline{R_i})(R_{j-t}-\overline{R_j})$
	* $Cov(R_i,R_j)=\frac{Cov(R_i,R_j)}{SD(R_i)SD(R_j)}$
	* $\begin{align} Var(R_p) & = x_1^2Var(R_1)+x_2^2Var(R_2)+2x_1x_2Cov(R_1,R_2)  \\ &= x_1^2SD(R_1)^2+x_2^2SD(R_2)^2+2x_1x_2Corr(R_1,R_2)SD(R_1)SD(R_2) \end{align}$
* **The Volatility of a Large Portfolio**
	* $\begin{align}Var(R_p)= & \frac{1}{n}(Average\ Variance\ of\ the\ Individual Stocks) \\& + (1-\frac{1}{n})(Average Covariance between the Stocks) \end{align}$
	* $SD(R_p)=\sum_i x_i \times SD(R_i)\times Corr(R_i,R_p)$
	* 
* **Risk Versus Return: Choosing an Efficient Portfolio**

* **Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing**
	* $E[R_{xP}] = r_f + x(E[R_p]-r_f)$
	* $SD(R_{xp}) = xSD(R_p)$
	* $$Sharpe\ Ratio = \frac{Portfolio\ Excess\ Return}{Portfolio\ Volatility}= \frac{E[R_p]-r_f}{SD(R_p)}$$
* **The Efficient Portfolio and Required Returns**
	* $\beta_i^p \equiv \frac{SD(R_i)\times Corr(R_i,R_p)}{SD(R_p)}$
	* $r_i \equiv r_f+\beta_i^p \times (E[R_P]-r_f)$
	* $E[R_i]=r_i \equiv r_f+\beta_i^{eff} \times(E[R_{eff}]-r_f)$
	*
