# Fundamentals of Risk and Insurance

## CHAPTER 1 The Problem of Risk

### The concept of Risk
- Current Definitions
	-  The outcome must be in question.
	-  At least one of the possible outcomes is

- **Our Definition**: a condition of the real world in which there is an exposure to adversity.
	- Risk is a condition in which there is a possibility of an adverse deviation from a desired outcome that is expected or hoped for.

### The Degree of Risk

- Degree of risk is related to the likelihood of occurrence. It is measured by the probability of the adverse deviation

### Risk Distinguished from Peril and Hazard

- The terms **peril** and **hazard** are commonly used interchangeably with each other and with risk.
- **A peril** is a cause of a loss.
- **A hazard**, on the other hand, is a condition that may create or increase the chance of a loss arising from a given peril.
	1. _Physical hazard_ consists of those physical prop- erties that increase the chance of loss from the various perils.
	2. _Moral hazard_ refers to the increase in the prob- ability of loss that results from dishonest tenden- cies in the character of the insured person.
	3. _Morale hazard_, not to be confused with moral hazard, acts to increase losses where insurance exists, not necessarily because of dishonesty but because of a different attitude toward losses that will be paid by insurance. 
	4. _Legal hazard_ refers to the increase in the frequency and severity of loss that arises from legal doctrines enacted by legislatures and created by the courts. 

	
### Classifications of Risk
##### Static and Dynamic Risks
- **Dynamic risks** are those resulting from changes in the economy. 
	- a source of gain to society
	- less predictable.
- **Static risks** involve those losses that would occur even if there were no changes in the economy. 
	- not a source of gain to society
	- predictable


##### Fundamental and Particular Risks
- **Fundamental risks** involve losses that are impersonal in origin and conse- quence.
- **Particular risks** involve losses that arise out of individual events and are felt by individuals rather than by the entire group.
- Based on the difference in the origin and conse- quences of the losses.

##### Pure and Speculative Risks
- **Speculative risk** describes a situation in which there is a possibility of loss but also a possibility of gain.
- **Pure risk** is used to designate those situations that involve only the chance of loss or no loss.
	1. Personal risks
	2. Property risks
	3. Liability risks
	4. Risks arising from failure of others

##### Systemic Risk
- **Systemic risk** refers to a risk that can affect an entire system, rather than just one entity.

## CHAPTER 2 Introduction to Risk Management

### ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

- **Enterprise risk management**: _attempts to integrate the management of all of the firm’s pure and speculative risks._ Enterprise risk management, seeks to identify the risks facing the firm, to quantify those risks, and to manage the risks efficiently consistent with the firm’s strategic objectives.

- **Financial risk**
	- **Market risk** is the risk arising from adverse move- ments in market prices. 
	- **Credit risk** is the risk arising from the potential that a borrower will fail to pay a debt.
	- **Liquidity risk** is the risk that the business will have insufficient liquid assets to meet obligations that come due.

- **Operational risk** defined as the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events.

- **Reputational risk**: the potential that negative pub- licity will cause a loss.
- **Strategic risk**: the risk of failing to successfully implement the firm’s strategies- **Compliance risk**: the risk of failing to comply with laws and regulations.

### RISK MANAGEMENT DEFINED
- **Risk management** is a scientific approach to dealing with risks by anticipating possible losses and designing and implementing procedures that mini- mize the occurrence of loss or the financial impact of the losses that do occur.

### RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS
- **Risk Control**
	- Risk control focuses on minimizing the risk of loss to which the firm is exposed and includes the techniques of avoidance and reduction.
	- **Risk Avoidance**
		- Prevent a risk from even coming into existence
	- **Risk Reduction**
		- designed to reduce the likelihood of loss or the potential severity of those losses that do occur.
- **Risk Financing**
	- Risk financing concentrates on arranging the availability of funds to meet losses arising from the risks that remain after the application of risk control techniques and includes the tools of retention and transfer.
	- **Risk Retention**
	- **Risk Transfer**

### RISK MANAGEMENT AS A BUSINESS FUNCTION
- Risk management can contribute directly to profit by controlling the cost of risk for the organization.
- Risk management can reduce expenses through risk control measures.
- Risk management can increase income.
- Risk management can permit an organization to engage in activities that involve speculative risk by minimizing the pure risks associated with such ventures.

### MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT

- The **first** misconception is that the risk management concept is applicable principally to large organizations. 
- The **second** is that the risk manage- ment approach to dealing with pure risks seeks to minimize the role of insurance.
	
### THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

1. **Determination of objectives**2. **Identification of risks**
	- *Risk Identification Techniques*
		1. Analysis of Documents
		2. Flowcharts
		3. InternalCommunicationSystem
	- *Tools of Risk Identification*
		1. Risk Analysis Questionnaires
		2. Exposure Checklists
		3. Insurance Policy Checklists
		4. Expert Systems
	3. **Evaluation of risks**
	- *Criticality analysis*: an attempt to distinguish the important factors from the overwhelming mass of unimportant ones.
	- *Critical risks* include all exposures to loss in which the possible losses are of a magnitude that would result in bankruptcy.	- *Important risks* include those exposures in which the possible losses would not result in bankruptcy but would require the firm to borrow in order to continue operations.	- *Unimportant risks* include those exposures in which the possible losses could be met out of the existing assets or current income of the firm with- out imposing undue financial strain.
	- *The Loss Unit Concept*: The loss unit is the total of all financial losses that could re- sult from a single event, taking into consideration the various exposures. 4. **Consideration of alternatives and selection of the risk treatment device**5. **Implementation of the decision**6. **Evaluation and review**
	- *Control requires three steps*:
		1. Setting standards or objectives to be achieved;
		2. Measuring performance against those standards and objectives;
		3. Taking corrective action when results differ from the intended results.
	- *Risk Management Audits*
		- A risk management audit is a detailed and systematic review of a risk man- agement program, designed to determine whether the objectives of the program are appropriate to the needs of the organization, whether the mea- sures designed to achieve those objectives are suitable, and whether the measures have been properly implemented.


## CHAPTER 3 The Insurance Device

### THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF INSURANCE

- **Risk Sharing and Risk Transfer**
	1. Transferring or shifting risk from one individual to a group	2. Sharing losses, on some equitable basis, by all members of the group

- _**Insurance from the Viewpoint of the Individual**_
	- **Definition**: Insurance is an economic device whereby the individual substi- tutes a small certain cost (the premium) for a large uncertain financial loss (the contingency insured against) that would exist if it were not for the insurance.
	- **PPT**
		- The **primary function** of insurance is the creation of the counterpart of risk, which  is security. 		- Insurance **does not decrease the uncertainty** for the individual as to whether  the event will occur,  nor does it alter  the  probability  of occurrence.  		- Insurance **does reduce the probability**  of financial  loss connected with the event.

- **Risk Reduction Through Pooling**
	- The risk an insurer faces is not merely a summation of risks transferred to it by individuals.	- Insurer can predict within narrow limits the amount of losses that will occur.	- If insurer could predict future losses with absolute precision, it would have no risk.	- Accuracy of insurer’s prediction is based on **the law of large numbers**.- **Probability Theory and Law of Large Numbers**
	- Probability theory is the body of knowledge concerned with measuring the likelihood that something will happen and making predictions based on this likelihood.- **Two Interpretations of Probability**
	1.	**Relative frequency interpretation**signifies the relative frequency of occurrence expected, given a large number of separate independent trials.	2.	**Subjective interpretation**probability is measured by the degree of belief  (e.g., a student says she has a 50:50 chance of getting a B in a course).- **Posteriori Probabilities**	- These probabilities,computed after a study of past experience, are called a posteriori or empirical probabilities.


- _**Insurance Defined from the Viewpoint of Society**_
	- From the social point of view, insurance is an economic device for reducing and eliminating risk through the process of combining a sufficient number of homogeneous exposures into a group to make the losses predictable for the group as a whole.


### ELEMENTS OF AN INSURABLE RISK
1. There must be a sufficiently large number of homogeneous exposure units to make the losses reasonably predictable. 
2. The loss produced by the risk must be definite and measurable. 
3. The loss must be fortuitous or accidental. 
4. The loss must not be catastrophic. 


### THE FIELDS OF INSURANCE
- **Private (Voluntary) Insurance**
	1. Life insurance	2. Health insurance	3. Property and liability insurance
	
	- voluntary programs designed to protect individual against financial loss	
	- Usually (but not always) voluntary.	- Usually (but not always) offered by private insurers.	

- **Social Insurance**
	- compulsory insurance programs generally operated by government

- **Public Benefit Guarantee Programs**
	- quasi-social coverages usually associated with regulation.

- **Federal Public Guarantee Insurance Programs**
	- Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation	- National Credit Union Administration	- Securities Investor Protection Corporation	- Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation

## CHAPTER 4 Risk Management Applicationss


### RISK MANAGEMENT DECISIONS
- **Utility Theory**
	- The theory of marginal utility was constructed by economists in an attempt to explain why people make the consumer choices they do.

- **Decision Theory**
	- The decision theory approach aims at identifying the best deci- sion or solution to the problem.

- **The Rules of Risk Management**
	- Don’t Risk More Than You Can Afford to Lose
	- Consider the Odds
	- Don’t Risk a Lot for a Little

- **A Priority Ranking for Insurance Expenditures**
	- **Essential insurance** coverages include those de- signed to protect against loss exposures that could result in bankruptcy. Insurance coverage required by law is also essential.	- **Important insurance** coverages include those that protect against loss exposures that would force the insured to borrow or resort to credit.	- **Optional insurance** coverages include those that protect against losses that could be met out of existing assets or current income.

- **Large-Loss Principle**: Essential Coverages First
- **Insurance as a Last Resort**: Optional Coverages


## CHAPTER 5 The Private Insurance Industry


### CLASSIFICATION OF PRIVATE INSURERS
- **Classification by Type of Product**
	- *Life insurance* companies sell life insurance, annuities and health insurance
	- *Property and liability insurance* companies market all forms of property and liability insurance (including health insurance) but do not write life insurance.


- **Classification by Place of Incorporation and Licensing**
	- A *domestic* insurer & A *foreign* insurer
	- A *licensed* (or admitted) insurer & An *unlicensed* (or nonadmitted) insurer

- **Insurers Classification by Legal Form of Ownership**
	1. Capital stock insurance companies	2. Mutual insurance companies	3. Reciprocals or interinsurance exchanges 
	4. Lloyd’s associations	5. Health expense associations	6. Government insurers

- **Reasons for Government Insurance**
	- Fundamental risks that require compulsion and lack equity	- Hazard considered too great by private insurance	- Adverse selection against private insurersTools of social change by government	- Mistaken notion that government can repeal the law of averages
### MARKETING SYSTEMS
- **Distinction Between Agent and Broker**
	- **Agent:** an individual authorized by an insurer to create, modify, and terminate contracts of insurance.	- **Broker:** a representative of the insured who solicits business from insurance buyers but who is compensated by the insurer.	- The agent can “bind” an insurer to a risk.	- A broker does not have binding authority.
- **Corporate Combinations**
	- Insurance company groups or fleets		- Originally formed in monoline era to combine property and casualty coverages	- Underwriting syndicates		- Insurers join together to handle risks that would be beyond the capacity of an individual company 		- An example is US Aircraft Insurance Group, which offers insurance for aviation risks### COMPETITION IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

- **Price Competition**
	- Insurance companies compete on the basis of price by attempting to offer a lower priced product than other companies dealing in the same line of insurance.
	- occurs  primarily at the company level

- **Costs Common to All Insurers**
	1.	Losses and loss adjustment expense	2.	Acquisition expense	3.	Administrative expense (company overhead)	4.	Taxes	5.	Profit and contingencies- **Quality Competition**
	- Insurance companies compete by offering broader forms of coverage and prompt claim service. 
	- occurs primarily at the agency or brokerage level


- **Evidence of Intensity of Competition**	1. Industry is highly cyclical, indicating inability to control output, prices, or profits.	2. Profits in recent years have consistently been below those for most industries.	3. Recurring insurer insolvencies indicate an intense degree of price competition.
